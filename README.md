Q5) Write a program to Validate an IPv4 Address. According to Wikipedia, IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four     decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1 . The generalized form of an IPv4 address is (0-255).(0-255).(0-255).(0-255).     Here we are considering numbers only from 0 to 255 and any additional leading zeroes will be considered invalid.

Q6) Given an integer n. Return the nth row of the following look-and-say pattern.

            1211
            111221
